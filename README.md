# Better-Leaderboard
Utility Mod for GeoGuessr that adds search features to challenge leaderboards
One day, I was playing one of my favorite games, GeoGuessr. It is an amazing game and I've learned so much about geography from it, but it has some flaws.

When you finish the daily challenge(or any other challenge mode game) on GeoGuessr, you can see a leaderboard with the results of every user who played the challenge, starting with the top 26 players. 
By default, there is no option to search by username or by ranking on the leaderboard, and the game doesn't tell you how you placed. This extension changes that. Better Leaderboard lets you:
1) See how many players played the challenge
2) View the results of any custom range of 200 users on the leaderboard
3) Search for any user on the leaderboard
4) Download all of the results as a .json file.<br/><br/>
Better Leaderboard started as a userscript that I hosted on greasyfork. Then, I published it and the Chrome Web Store. You can preview it and download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/geoguessr-better-leaderbo/jfipnkcdgkdndjndmkkcbmnlminnlfbn)
